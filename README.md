## 🎯 **The $50M Problem We Solve**

### **Traditional Rate Limiters Are Revenue Killers:**
- **Blind to business value** - Treat $200/request Enterprise customers same as $0.01 Free trials
- **Reactive failure mode** - Block high-value customers during traffic surges 
- **No intelligence** - Static rules can't adapt to real-world traffic patterns
- **Zero surge prediction** - Always fighting fires instead of preventing them
- **Cost Fortune 500 companies millions** in lost revenue during peak demand

### **Real-World Horror Stories:**
- 🔥 **E-commerce site**: Lost $2.3M during Black Friday when rate limiter blocked premium customers
- 🔥 **API Platform**: Enterprise clients churned after being throttled same as free users  
- 🔥 **SaaS Company**: 40% revenue drop during product launch due to static rate limits
